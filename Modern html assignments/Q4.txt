Improving the accessibility of HTML involves implementing practices that ensure web content can be effectively consumed by users with diverse abilities and disabilities. Here are three ways to enhance HTML accessibility:

Use Semantic HTML:

Employing semantic HTML elements such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, and <footer> provides a clear and meaningful structure to web documents.
Properly nesting and organizing content using semantic elements helps screen readers and other assistive technologies interpret and convey the information more accurately.

Provide Alternative Text for Images (Alt Text):

Include descriptive alternative text (alt attribute) for all images to convey their meaning to users who may not be able to see them. This is crucial for users with visual impairments who rely on screen readers.
The alt text should be concise, descriptive, and convey the purpose or content of the image.

Ensure Keyboard Accessibility:

Design web pages to be navigable and operable using a keyboard alone. This is particularly important for users with motor disabilities who may rely on keyboard input or alternative input devices.
Test and ensure that all interactive elements, links, and form controls can be accessed and activated using the "tab" key, and that their states and focus are clearly visible.
