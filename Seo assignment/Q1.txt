SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is a set of strategies and techniques aimed at improving a website's visibility on search engines like Google. The goal is to enhance the site's ranking in search results, making it more likely to be seen by users searching for relevant information. SEO involves optimizing content, using relevant keywords, improving website structure, and acquiring high-quality backlinks.

The importance of SEO lies in its ability to drive organic traffic to a website. As the majority of online experiences begin with a search engine, a higher ranking increases the chances of attracting visitors. Improved visibility leads to increased credibility, trust, and ultimately, more conversions. In a highly competitive online landscape, effective SEO is crucial for businesses and individuals looking to establish a strong online presence and reach their target audience.
